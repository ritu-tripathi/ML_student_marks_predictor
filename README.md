# ML_student_marks_predictor
Made on google colab. 
This a Machine Leaning Project on students marks predictor. We calculate the marks of the students on the basis of the number of hours they spend studying.
I have used python libraries Numpy , Pandas and Matplotlib for the following code. In the code you will find use of some basic functions like head() , tail() , show(), mean() and many more just to provide a basic understanding of how the program works and how we obtain our final results.
A scatter plot in the end of the program is shown for graphical point of view and to establish relation between the variables.
I have made this project under my mentoship program in Lean In Bansthali Vidyapith.
Thank you.
